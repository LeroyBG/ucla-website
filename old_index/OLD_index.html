        <p>you can also create quotes for block level things like lists and paragraphs</p>
        <blockquote
        cite = "http://leroylightning.bol.ucla.edu/">
            Hey wassup guys this is a huge paragraph I'm plagiarizing from somewhere else well actually
            i'm not plagiarizing it because i put it in quotes! let's go baby wait just kidding i made
            all of this up and if you copied and pasted it onto your website without giving me permission
            YOU'D be plagiarizing ME. oh also you can make things look like <code>code</code> with the 
            &lt;code&gt; element. I also used the 'cite' attribute with blockquote to show the source of
            this paragraph.
        </blockquote>
        <p>you can also use <code>&lt;q&gt;</code>, <q
            cite = "http://leroylightning.bol.ucla.edu/"
            >which work the same as quotes,</q> but they allow
        you to add a source</p>

        <p>you can also write in <sup>superscript</sup>and<sub>subscript</sub>.</p>
        
        <!-- time -->
        <p>this time is not only readable to humans, but machines too (thanks to the <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> element)</p>
        <time datetime = "2003-09">september 2003</time><br>
        <time datetime = "2003-09-11">september 11th, 2003</time><br>
        <time datetime = "10:30:33.94">10:30:33.94, around 10:30 am</time><br>
        <time datetime = "2003-09-11T06:30">6:30 am on september 11th 2003</time><br>
